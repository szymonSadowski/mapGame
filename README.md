# MapGame

[MapGame](https://map-game.vercel.app/) is simple webapp created that enables you to complete quizes based on geography.

## Technologies used

1. [**Next.Js:**](https://nextjs.org/) no needs for introductions :)
2. [**Radix:**](https://www.radix-ui.com/) a unstyled UI library providing primitives to style them by yourself.
3. [**Stitches:**](https://stitches.dev/) CSS in JS with low runtime, srr, multi-variant and tokenization support
4. [**React Simple Maps:**](https://www.react-simple-maps.io/) interactive SVG maps created with d3-geo and topojson
5. [**Supabase:**](https://supabase.com/) used as backend as a service, firebase altrernative. Provides login and auth

## Getting started

Use our handy CLI command to spin up a MapGame: `yarn` and `yarn dev`. For all functionalities you will need to provide supabase variables. Put them in .env.local file and all should work fine ðŸš€

## Feature set

This project is something I made in my free time with technologies that I enjoy! [demo](https://map-game.vercel.app/).
